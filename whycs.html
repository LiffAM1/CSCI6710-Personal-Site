				<h3>Why Computer Science?</h3>
				<p>
					I have been in software for several years at this point and very much enjoy it. It's not just a job for me but something that I can lose myself in! I felt that it was important to get a more in-depth grasp of the theoretical aspects of Computer Science (algorithms, discrete math, data science, etc) so I came back to school in 2021. I have been able to apply what I have learned about Computer Science in a hands-on way at my job and look forward to learning even more before graduation.
